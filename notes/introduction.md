# Angular: The Strictly Typed Superset of AngularJS

**Angular** is a _superset_ of the **AngularJS** framework. It introduces **TypeScript** as the primary language for building Angular applications. This means that you get the benefits of static typing, including _strict type checking_, in your Angular applications.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. It adds optional static typing, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript, making it easier to write large and complex applications.

## The Advantages of TypeScript with Angular

1. **Strict Type Checking**: With TypeScript, you can catch errors at compile time, resulting in fewer bugs and easier debugging.

2. **Better Code Readability**: TypeScript's static typing helps improve code readability by making the codebase more self-documenting.

3. **Enhanced Tooling**: TypeScript integrates well with popular IDEs and provides rich tooling support, including code autocompletion, refactoring, and debugging.

4. **Larger Community**: The TypeScript community is growing rapidly, and there are many resources, libraries, and frameworks available to help you build your Angular applications.

5. **Long-Term Support**: Angular is committed to supporting TypeScript as the primary language for building Angular applications, ensuring that your code will continue to run smoothly in the long term.

In conclusion, Angular is the strictly typed superset of AngularJS that offers a wide range of benefits for building large and complex applications. With its support for TypeScript, Angular provides a powerful development environment that helps you catch errors early, improve code readability, and build applications that are easier to maintain and scale.
